# A Note from Kevin

Hi! If you're at this repo, you've probably seen one of my AI coding videos and want to try some of those techniques yourself. If you have no clue what I'm talking about, here's a good video to show you my approach and how to best use this repo: https://youtu.be/gXmakVsIbF0

You can also just use this with your own techniques, that's cool too. 

You can follow the Getting Started instructions below to start using this stack right away. I've found that using a checklist of tasks in the .cursor-tasks.md file is a great way to make a lot of quick and effective progress with AI Coding. I personally use Cursor in Composer Agent mode with Sonnet 3.7, but feel free to use your AI coding tool of choice.

If you need to create the checklist, here are some good prompts to use to go from a high-level idea to a full checklist of stories and tasks: https://chatgpt.com/share/67be0a59-e484-800d-a078-346b2c29d727

You can also use the template in .cursor-template.xml to generate the task list for existing repos. I personally use RepoPrompt to convert the files into a pastable string, but repomix.com is a good option as well. 

# üöÄ Next.js Modern Stack Template

A Next.js template that combines commonly used tools and libraries for building full-stack web applications. This stack is specifically designed to be optimized for AI coding assistants like Cursor.

## üéØ Overview

This template includes [Next.js 14](https://nextjs.org/) with the App Router, [Supabase](https://supabase.com) for the database, [Resend](https://resend.com) for transactional emails, and optional integrations with various AI providers and AWS services.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This is my personal template with tools that I personally have experience with and think are solid options for building modern full-stack web application. Your preferences very likely differ, so feel free to fork and modify it for your own use. I won't be accepting pull requests for additional features, but I'll be happy to help you out if you have any questions.
